    <p>
      Custodians are the users who will upload files to the project. So for each
      project, you will have to add custodians who will have access to add files
      to your project. <br />To add custodians to a project, open the project
      details by clicking on the <b>View</b> button. Click on the
      <b>Add Custodians</b> button in the detail view.
    </p>

    <img src="images/image106.png" />

      custodians, click on the <b>Finish</b> button in the top right corner.
    </p>

    <h5>Import Bulk Custodians</h5>
    <p>
      If you wish to add more custodians, you can continue adding by either

      have to follow a template, which can be accessed by clicking on the
      information button -> Sample CSV File.
    </p>
    <img src="images/image56.png" />
    <p>
      Once you have completed adding the custodians, click on the
      <b>Finish</b> button in the top right corner.

      <b>Finish</b> button, you will see a prompt asking to generate a new
      request:
    </p>

    <img src="images/image15.png" />
    <p>
      You will then be asked to create a new request by filling in the required
      details. After adding the request subject, request message, and selecting
      the custodians that you wish to notify, click on the <b>Send</b> button.
    </p>

    <img src="images/image23.png" />
    <p>
      The selected custodians will receive the request via Email or Phone Number
      as per your choice. As we had selected Email, the following email was
      received by the custodian:
    </p>

    <img src="images/image45.png" />
    <p>
      Consequently, you will be able to see the generated requests in your
      project’s detailed view.
    </p>

    <img src="images/image100.png" />
    <p>
      To view the custodians of the project, click on a request. A screen will
      open showing all the custodians of that project, along with an option to
      resend the notification in case a custodian has missed it.

      <i>Total Uploaded Size</i> of the custodian, i.e. the average time it took
      the custodian to upload files, and the total size of all the files
      uploaded by the custodian, respectively.
    </p>
    <img src="images/image50.png" />
