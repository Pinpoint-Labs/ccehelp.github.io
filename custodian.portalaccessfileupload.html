      Click on the <b>Generate OTP for Login</b> button. You will receive an OTP

    <p>
      <b>File Upload</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      After you have logged in successfully, you will then see a similar screen:

      You can either drop files into the upload box or select any source to

    <p>
      Click on <b>Add More</b> to add more files to the upload, else click on
      the <b>Upload File</b> button. You will be prompted to add a note
      regarding your uploaded file(s).
    </p>

    <img style="width: 55%" src="images/image39.png" />
    <p>
      Enter your note, save, and continue to start your upload. You will be able
      to see your uploaded files at the bottom of your screen:
    </p>

    <img src="images/image90.png" />
    <p>
      To view the details of your uploaded files, click on the arrow on the
      <b>File View</b> button. If you click on the down arrow, you will be able
      to see files in a hierarchy:
    </p>

    <img src="images/image65.png" />
    <p>
      Whereas, if you click on the <b>File View</b> button, you will be able to
      see a view with file details only:
    </p>

    <img src="images/image73.png" />
    <p>
      After you have uploaded the files, click on the <b>Iâ€™m Done</b> button:
    </p>

    <img src="images/image68.png" />
    <p>You will see a prompt:</p>

    <img style="width: 55%" src="images/image83.png" />
    <p>
      If you wish to upload more files later, select the
      <b>Done for now</b> option, else click on <b>Completely Done</b>. Click on
      Continue. <br />If you click on the former, you will be able to log in
      again and upload more files. Otherwise, you will be permanently logged out
      and will not be able to access again, unless the admin generates a new
      request.
