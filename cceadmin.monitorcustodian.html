    <p>
      To monitor a custodian’s activities, go to the custodian’s detailed view.

      the custodian to upload files, and the total size of all the files

        download a CSV containing the list and details of all the files in the

      Click on the <i>No. of Files</i> for a specific job to open a detailed
      view of the job.

      job. You can apply filters on the table to view files by the uploaded
      source, such as Local System, Google Drive, etc. Moreover, you can add and
      remove columns from the table according to your needs.

      For example: <br />
      I have hidden the target path but want to see Hash Type and Hash Match. So
      I’ll uncheck the Target Path checkbox, and mark the checkboxes against
      Hash Type and Hash Match.
