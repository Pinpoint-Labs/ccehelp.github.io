      If you have closed the window and wish to resume uploading files, you can
      follow the same steps as <i>Portal Access</i>. Go ahead and similarly
      upload more files as <i>File Upload</i>. <br /><br />You will be able to
      see the newly uploaded files along with the previously uploaded ones in
      the files list.
